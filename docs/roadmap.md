## The Vision: Context Libraries

Lola aims to enable **community-driven context libraries**:

```bash
# Future vision
lola mod install @context-libs/jira-optimization
lola mod install @context-libs/calendar-integration
lola mod install @context-libs/code-review
```

**Benefits:**
- Reusable, battle-tested contexts
- Share proven patterns across projects
- Standardized approaches to common tasks
- Community-driven improvements
- Version control for contexts

## Use Cases

**Personal Assistant**
- Load calendar context when discussing schedule
- Load task context when managing todos
- Load journal context when reflecting

**Development Workflow**
- Load code review context for PRs
- Load testing context for test writing
- Load documentation context for docs

**Content Creation**
- Load blog context for writing posts
- Load social media context for tweets
- Load technical context for articles

**Specialized Assistants**
- Baking assistant (chef-buddy example)
- Fitness coach
- Learning tutor
- Research assistant

## Security Considerations

Context files control LLM behavior - use responsibly:

- Review contexts before installation
- Be cautious with scripts from untrusted sources
- Understand what contexts do
- Audit context loading (planned feature)

## Roadmap
