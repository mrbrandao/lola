## Context

Lola's current Python implementation has hardcoded registries for assistant targets
(`TARGETS` dict in `targets/__init__.py`) and source handlers (`SOURCE_HANDLERS` list
in `parsers.py`). Adding support for a new AI assistant or module source type requires
modifying the core codebase.

As the AI assistant ecosystem grows — new assistants, agent frameworks, skill
registries, and security scanning needs emerging regularly — this hardcoded approach
does not scale. We need an extension system that allows any developer to add support
for new capabilities without forking or modifying the Lola core binary.

## Decision

Introduce a formal extension system with the following extension kinds:

| Kind | What it extends | Built-in examples |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| `target` | Where skills are installed (assistant file formats and paths) | claude-code, cursor, gemini-cli, openclaw, opencode |
| `repo` | Where skills are discovered (catalogs and registries) | yaml-catalog |
| `runtime` | Where skills are executed (agent framework environments) | — (future) |
| `source` | How skills are fetched (transport protocols) | git, zip, tar, folder |
| `scan` | How skills are validated (security scanning) | — (future) |

Extensions will use a YAML manifest (`extension.yaml`) and a language-agnostic
communication protocol. The detailed design — manifest schema, discovery flow,
protocol spec, and SDK interfaces — will be defined in a separate design document
once the Go project structure is established.

## Rationale

- **Language-agnostic**: Extensions can be written in any language
- **Process isolation**: External extensions run as separate processes, protecting core stability
- **Community extensibility**: Anyone can add a new assistant or catalog without a core release
- **Forward-compatible**: New extension kinds can be added without architectural changes

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- Community can add support for new assistants without forking Lola
- Custom skill catalogs are addable as repo extensions
- Security scanning is pluggable via scan extensions
- Built-in and external extensions share the same interface contract

### Negative Consequences

- External extensions have subprocess overhead compared to compiled built-ins
- Extension protocol must be versioned to avoid breaking changes

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Hardcoded handlers only
- Description: Continue adding new targets and sources directly to the core codebase
- Pros: Simple, no extension infrastructure needed
- Cons: Every new assistant requires a core release; community cannot contribute independently
- Reason for rejection: Does not scale with the growing AI assistant ecosystem

### Alternative 2: Shared library plugins (.so files)
- Description: Extensions as dynamically linked shared libraries
- Pros: No subprocess overhead, full Go type safety
- Cons: Not language-agnostic (Go-only), platform-specific binary compatibility issues
- Reason for rejection: Language-agnostic extensions are a core requirement

### Alternative 3: gRPC as initial protocol
- Description: Use gRPC from day one instead of stdin/stdout
- Pros: Strongly typed, supports streaming, concurrent calls
- Cons: Higher initial complexity, requires protobuf compilation for extension authors
- Reason for deferral: Start simple; gRPC is a planned future transport option
